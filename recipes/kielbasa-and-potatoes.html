    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a personal favorite of mine that I came up with myself! This is a simple one pot dish that is easy to create in just a few minutes!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 polish kielbasa </li>
        <li>4-5 medium sized red potatoes</li>
        <li>1 vidalia onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bunch of spinach</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp crushed red pepper</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Slice kielbasa into 1-inch pieces (slice diagonally for more even cooking) and cut red potatoes into 1-inch cubes, leave the skin on or peel depending on personel preference.</li>
        <li>Boil a pot of salted water and cook potatoes for ~8 minutes, cooked but still slightly firm. Meanwhile, in a dutch oven, cook kielbasa, onion, and garlic over medium until well browned.</li>
        <li>Mix potatoes with kielbasa and cook 3-4 minutes, until potatoes begin to brown.</li>
        <li>Wash spinach and cut any stems off, add the bunch of spinach to the pot and cook until spinach is wilted.</li>
        <li>Add salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool 5 minutes and serve.</li>
      </ol>
